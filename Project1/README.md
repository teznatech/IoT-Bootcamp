# Project 1

Covers how to headless configure a single board computer for an IoT environment.
Students will build a small surviellance station using a camera, temperature and humidity sensor,
pan and tilt camera base, and a set of RGB led arrays.
This project will show students how to build a secure internet connection with the station,
allowing users to see data and control the motors and leds.
Course takers should have a general understanding of basic circuitry, python scripting,
and web development.

The following materials are used:
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (any model compatible)
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Pi Camera
- Pan and Tilt camera base
- 8bit RGB Led Array
